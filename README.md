A bot to help Peace Corps volunteers order supplies. See the [Medlink](https://github.com/peacecorps/medlink) project for more information.

You can message the [@PCMedBot](https://telegram.me/PCMedBot), but will need to be a PCV with a Medlink account to do much. If you'd like to help out, or have any questions, please reach out to [@jamesdabbs](https://telegram.me/jamesdabbs).
